# Cash Register - Java Application
###  
### **Description**
> #### This Java project mimics the function of a cash register. It activates a dialog box where the user can input different amounts to compute the change due when mimicking a grocery or supermarket purchase. The program will ask the user to input an amount due and an amount paid for the purchase. And if there's any change due it will advise the end user.
